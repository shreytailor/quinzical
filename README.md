```
sudo apt-get install festival
sudo apt-get install festlex-oald
```

3. Place the `.jar` file, `run_game.sh` script, and `QuizBank` folder, which contains the two files for the New Zealand and International questions respectively, into a new directory of your choice.

4. Open the terminal and change the current working directory to the directory created above.

5.  To run the game, give executable permissions to the script file and run it.
